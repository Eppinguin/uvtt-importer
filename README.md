# UVTT Importer for Owlbear Rodeo

A Virtual Tabletop (VTT) map importer extension for [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). It imports maps with walls and doors from:

- Universal VTT (.uvtt) files
- DD2VTT (.dd2vtt) files
- FoundryVTT scene JSON files

Designed for use with the [Dynamic Fog Extension](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/dynamic-fog) for basic wall and door functionality. For advanced features, consider the [Smoke & Spectre Extension](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/smoke).

## Features

- Import maps from UVTT/DD2VTT files
- Automatic wall and door creation from the imported data
- Smart image optimization with multiple compression modes
- Support for placing walls and doors relative to selected items
- Automatic DPI adjustment based on grid size

## Usage

### Import a New Map with Walls and Doors

This will create a new scene, complete with the map image, walls, and doors from your VTT file.

1. Click the UVTT Importer icon in the top left corner.
2. Select your .uvtt or .dd2vtt file. (FoundryVTT .json files are not supported for new scene creation as they typically don't include a map image).
3. Choose your compression mode (see below).
4. Click "Create New Scene". This can take a moment, depending on the image size and compression.
5. Once the process is complete, a new scene with your map and all its walls and doors will be available in your scenes list.

_Note: If your UVTT file does not contain a map image, you will not be able to use the "Create New Scene" option. In this case, you should first set up your scene with a map image manually, and then use the "Add Walls to Current Scene" feature._

### Add Walls and Doors to an Existing Scene

You can add walls and doors to an existing scene in two ways:

1. Open the scene where you want to add walls/doors
2. Click the UVTT Importer button in the toolbar
3. Select your .uvtt, .dd2vtt, or .json file
4. Click "Add Walls to Current Scene"

#### Using the Map's Context Menu:

1. Select the Map you want to Import Walls for
2. Right Click it
3. Click "Import UVTT/DD2VTT File"
4. Select a File
5. Wait for Walls and Doors to be added to the Map

## Compression Modes

When importing maps, you can choose from three compression modes:

| Mode     | Description                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | Best for most maps (optimizes to ~24MB)               |
| Bestling | Better quality for detailed maps (optimizes to ~49MB) |
| None     | Uses original image format                            |

The two compressions will first convert the image to WebP and then incrementally reduce the quality of the image to fit the constraints.
